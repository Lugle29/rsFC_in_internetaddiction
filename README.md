Masters Thesis Assessing Neural Biomarkers for Internet Addiction via Predictive Modeling

In the project a published dataset by Mendes et al. (N = 186) was used to predict Internet Addiction (by IAT; Young, 1998) out of resting state functional connectivity (fMRI) by Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. The goal was to find neural biomarkers of this disease and to test the role of the reward-, self-reference and attention-network.

The codefiles are:

*functions.py*- Functions to retrieve, preprocess and analyse data which is called by the other scripts to keep them clean \n
*ml_analysis.py* - Code for machine learning algorithm incorporating k-fold CV (extra script) and created by David Steyrl 
sklearn_repeated_group_k_fold.py

Plots relevant wor the work are saved in the *plots* folder
